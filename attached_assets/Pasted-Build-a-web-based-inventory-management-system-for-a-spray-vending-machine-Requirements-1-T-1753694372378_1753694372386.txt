Build a web-based inventory management system for a spray vending machine.

ðŸŸ¦ Requirements:
1. The vending machine has:
   - 5 spray test slots (customers pay to test)
   - 15 bottle slots (3 size options for 5 perfume brands = 15 types)
2. All UI and inventory should be managed on a **single page dashboard** with separate sections for:
   - Spray Slot Management (5 slots)
   - Bottle Slot Management (15 slots)

ðŸŸ© Key Functionalities:
A. **Product Configuration Section (top of page)**:
   - Allow admin to add a new perfume product with the following inputs:
     - Brand Name (text)
     - Description (text)
     - Spray Price (number)
     - Bottle Prices (3 size options: Small, Medium, Large)
   - On submission, the new product gets listed and is available to be assigned to a slot.

B. **Spray Slot Management**:
   - Display 5 Spray Slots (Slot 1 to 5) with dropdown to assign a perfume product.
   - Show current product name and spray price.
   - Show current stock (editable input).
   - Buttons to increase/decrease stock manually.
   - "Remove" button to clear the slot.

C. **Bottle Slot Management**:
   - Display 15 Bottle Slots labeled Slot 1 to 15.
   - Each slot should:
     - Allow selection of Brand
     - Select bottle size (Small, Medium, Large)
     - Display corresponding bottle price
     - Stock quantity input
     - Buttons to add/remove quantity
     - "Clear slot" button

D. **Product List & Slot Syncing**:
   - Once a product is added in the config section, it should appear in dropdowns in both Spray and Bottle sections.
   - If a product is removed from the product list, all slots using it should be reset automatically.

E. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Store inventory and product data in localStorage (for demo purposes, no backend required).
   - Ensure state is retained across reloads.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or use React if preferred)
- Optional: TailwindCSS for clean UI
- No backend/database â€“ use localStorage or browser memory for state management.

ðŸ’¡ Refer to real vending UI systems like Vendekin or Vendify for layout ideas, with responsive and user-friendly design.
